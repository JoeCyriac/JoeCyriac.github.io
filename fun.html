    <h3><b><u>Movies</u></b></h3>

                <p> I love watching movies in my free time. Some genres that I love are <i>Comedy</i>, <i>Action</i>,
                    <i>Adventure</i>, and <i>Mystery</i>. This is one of many things my family loves to do together.
                    I try to watch a new movie every week!</p>
                <p>I have been a fan of Marvel characters since I was little and continue to watch all their
                    corresponding movies to this day. The most recent Marvel movie I have seen is Shang Chi.</p>

                <p>The only sport I actively watch is football. My favorite NFL team is the <a
                        href="https://www.vikings.com" target="_blank">Minnesota Vikings</a>. Every year I watch them
                    lose, but still continue to support them.
                    I hope they win a Super Bowl at somepoint during my lifetime!

                <p>Throughout middle school and high school, I was on the track and field team. A proud achievement of
                    mine is that I made the varsity team freshman year.
                    I participated in the 100 meter dash, 200 meter dash, and the 4x100 relay (which is a relay of 4
                    runners that run 100 meters each).
