                <p>From June 2021 - August 2021, I worked as an intern at Best Buy as an Information Security Risk
                    Analyst. I had a
                    chance to work with several leaders in Risk Management. During these meetings, we discussed several
                    threats and potential breaches
                    that are seen throughout the year. After conducting over 15 meetings, we then passed the information
                    to another team that was able to
                    put the risks discussed into a dollar amount and rank them by severity.

    <h3><b><u>History Sniffing Website</u></b></h3>
    <div class="grid-y">
        <div class="grid-x grid-padding-x grid-padding-x">
            <div class="cell small-auto medium-auto large-8">
                <br><br><br>
                <p>In my first Information Security class at the University of St. Thomas, my final project was to
                    create a website that sniffs the user's history
                    and recommends a major based off of what they see. Each color on the page is associated with a major
                    at the University of St. Thomas and would be invisible if the link had already been visited. For
                    example,
                    blue is linked to the science major page. An example of how the website works is as following: If
                    the user visting this site only sees the color blue,
                    they would type this in and press the "Submit" button. This would bring them to another page that
                    says they should look into majoring in science.
