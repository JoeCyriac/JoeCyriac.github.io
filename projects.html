                        <p>From June 2021 - August 2021, I worked as an intern at Best Buy as an Information Security
                            Risk
                            Analyst. I had a
                            chance to work with several leaders in Risk Management. During these meetings, we discussed
                            several
                            threats and potential breaches
                            that are seen throughout the year. After conducting over 15 meetings, we then passed the
                            information
                            to another team that was able to
                            put the risks discussed into a dollar amount and rank them by severity.

                        <p>In my first Information Security class at the University of St. Thomas, my final project was
                            to
                            create a website that sniffs the user's history
                            and recommends a major based off what they see. Each color on the page is associated with
                            a major
                            at the University of St. Thomas and would be invisible if the link had already been visited. For example,
                            blue is linked to the science major page.
                        </p> 
                        <br>
                        <p> An example of how the website works is as
                            following: If
                            the user visiting this site only sees blue in text,
                            they would type this color in and press the "Submit" button. This would bring them to another page
                            that
                            says they should look into majoring in science.

                        <p>When the pandemic started, I decided to make a couple simple apps on XCode and develop them
                            as time goes on. Pictured is
                            my Temperature Converter app on an iPhone 12. This app takes in user input for the degrees in Celsius and
                            outputs the equivalent temperature in Fahrenheit.
                            There is also another page that can be accessed by swiping that takes in user input for the
                            degrees in Fahrenheit and outputs the equivalent temperature in Celsius. Something I am planning on adding to the app
                            is an initial page that uses the current location and displays the corresponding temperature in both Fahrenheit and Celsius.
                        </p>

                        <p>Some other apps I have created are: Random Number Generator, Spin the Wheel, and Dice Roller.</p>
